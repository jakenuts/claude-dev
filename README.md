# Cline-Unleased

A fork of the amazing Cline (formerly Claude-Dev) that adds an 'Approve All' checkbox to the UI so you can turn full autonomy on & off at any time. See [ChatView.tsx](webview-ui/src/components/chat/ChatView.tsx) for the modified code. Other files have minor textual updates to identify the forked plugin as different than the normal one. They can run side-by-side without issue.
